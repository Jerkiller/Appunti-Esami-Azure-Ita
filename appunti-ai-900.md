* ML (predictive models based on data and statistics)
* Anomaly Detection (check if something is counterfeit or forced)
* Computer Vision (see and understand things. E.g. check people and if they're violent)
   * image classification -> what's this?
   * obj detection -> bounding box
   * semantic segmentaion -> classify shapes
   * image analysis -> from pic to caption
   * face detection and recognition - face service 4 age, happiness,identity
   * OCR - also text-written, identify forms (scontrini)
* NLP interpret lang
* Conversational AI agents or bots to engage with humans

A solution could use everything in this

cloud advantage

* data storage
* compute

Challenge and risk

* bias can affect result (e.g. loan approval model could be affected by gender)
* error can cause harm
* data exposure
* solutions may not work 4 everyone
* users must trust a complex system
* who's liable 4 ai-driven decisions

MS Principles

* fairness
* reliability & safety
* inclusiveness
* privacy & sec
* accountability
* transparency
