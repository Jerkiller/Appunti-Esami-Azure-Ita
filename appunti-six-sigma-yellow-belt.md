## Notes

* Six Sigma from deviation of a process
  * 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO)
  * Process must be repetitive in its output, input, times... around the mean
* Waste is a silent saboteur
* DMAIC Define Measure Anlyze Improve Control
* TIM WOODS
  * Transport
  * Inventory (and WIP)
  * Movement
  * Waiting
  * Over production
  * Over processing
  * Defects
  * Skills
* VoC - what the customer wants and needs (must know who are the customer and what they value)
* CtQ - set of goals that are **Critical to Quality** that must be satisified
  * CtQ-Flowdown/Tree - tree diagram from VoC to CtQ
  * QDF - Quality Function Deployment - house of quality map CtQ and VoC
  * CtQ like must be quick in answering calls, specified CtQ like must answer in less than 30 sec
  * Prioritize CtQ
* See the process / start to finish or finish to start. Measure, speak, ask quetions. Gemba walk, process walk
  * To optimize movement, spaghetti diagram (map with curves of how people moves during process)
* SIPOC or COPIS - scheme to map the process / diagram Supplier Input Process Output Customer
  * to avoid "scope creep": uncontrolled expansion of requirements and growth in scope
* Value Stream Map - 3 kinds: Current Ideal and Future states
  * Swim lanes - VSM where material moves between departments
  * what to include? every subprocess has boxes with data, include times, waiting times, resources, quality metrics, arrows, inventory supplies
  * add stars for kanban bursts (initiatives)
  * Lead Time - time to go through the process
  * Identify Value added steps and non value added ones.
    * Value added step if and only if: customer pays (only the first time and only if done correctly) and it changes shape, form, fit
    * In the non value steps there can be business value (something internally important or required) e.g. paying taxes
  * Cycle Time C/T - time for a pieces to be made
  * ChangeOver Time C/O - time to change production
  * Other KPIs [here](https://www.dmaic.com/value-stream-mapping-value-stream-analysis/)
* Who is going to do what? in which priority/order? -> define an **action plan**
  * PICK chart (Possible Implement Consider Kill)
  * 2x2 Quadrant - x=Effort^(-1) y=Benefit
