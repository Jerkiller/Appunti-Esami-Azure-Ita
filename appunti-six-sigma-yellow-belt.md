  * Defects
  * Skills
* VoC - what the customer wants and needs (must know who are the customer and what they value)
* CtQ - set of goals that are **Critical to Quality** that must be satisified
  * CtQ-Flowdown/Tree - tree diagram from VoC to CtQ

  * CtQ like must be quick in answering calls, specified CtQ like must answer in less than 30 sec
  * Prioritize CtQ
* See the process / start to finish or finish to start. Measure, speak, ask quetions. Gemba walk, process walk
  * To optimize movement, spaghetti diagram (map with curves of how people moves during process)
* SIPOC or COPIS - scheme to map the process / diagram Supplier Input Process Output Customer
  * to avoid "scope creep": uncontrolled expansion of requirements and growth in scope
* Value Stream Map - 3 kinds: Current Ideal and Future states
  * what to include? every subprocess has boxes with data, include times, waiting times, resources, quality metrics, arrows, inventory supplies
  * add stars for kanban bursts (initiatives)
  * Lead Time - time to go through the process
  * Cycle Time C/T - time for a pieces to be made
  * ChangeOver Time C/O - time to change production
