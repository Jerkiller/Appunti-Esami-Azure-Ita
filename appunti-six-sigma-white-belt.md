# Notes for Six-Sigma white belt exam

## Exam

* AIGPE issues the certification
* 30 multiple choice questions
* no time limit, available resources, 2 attempts, then 30$

## Quality

Duran - Q. is fitness for use. All the features that meet the needs of customers.
Deming (PDCA) - Anything that enhance satisfaction
ASQ - totalit of features to satisfy needs

--> Meeting customers expectations * Needs and expectations change over time
* understanding customer needs
* designing to satisfy needs
* developing those products
* controlling & managing

### History

* Taylorism / Fordism - separation of work
* QCD invented - department to check quality
* 1920 Shawhart -> Quality Control Charts
* 1979 Japan -> Quality circles (focus groups to improve Q)
* mid1980 - SPC SQC
* 1987 - ISO 9000 standards
* 1985-1988 Motorola - Six Sigma
* 2000 - Lean Manufacturing

## Six Sigma

> Struuctured disciplined process to deliver quality products and services, eliminating defects

* Well-defined projects
* Statistical thinking
* DMAIC (Define measure analyse improve control)

Philosophy
* Output = f(Input) f is process
* 7 basic tools of Q

Methodology
* DMAIC identify -> implement

Metric
* 3.4 defects / million opportunities

### 99% vs six-sigma

> six-sigma = 99.9997% vs 99%

* 110.000 babies dropped by doctors and nurses with 99% / <38 babies in six-sigma
* 85h blackout per year / 9min blackout every 5y in six-sigma
* 16 accident per day / 2 accidents per year in 6-sigma

### DMAIC

* similar to PDCA
* define issues, collect data, study data, act on the data (experiments) and control change
* continuous improvement - organisation grows but may regress as soon as stop spending on improvements
* continual improvement - cycles of growth and stabilize the situation, steady growth path pattern
* driving forces for six-sigma:
  *  continual improvement
  *  involve everyone
  *  IT group assist
  *  financial data - cost of Q analysis

### Seven quality tools

1. Process Mapping
   * Workflow of tasks and decisions, understanding and articulating how we deliver prod/serv to customer. Which process take more time? How toi improve? Standard operation procedure, traiuning
   * SIPOC - Supplier Input Process Output Customer - process map template in one page
   * Supplier who are internaÃ²l and external
   * Inputs - which are the materials, which metrics, knowledge data
   * Process - 5-7 high level steps in the process
   * Outputs - what're created
   * Customers - who are internal/ext customers
   * SIPOC - define boundaries of process - define consensus between stakeholders on process and struuctured discussion
   * SIPOC - 1-page, effectiveness, understand customer requirements, scope, suppliers and customers
   * SIPOC refers to exactly today.
   * identify and verify everything in Sipoc
2. Check Sheets
   * Simple effective Way to collect data
   * A check sheet refers to a single well-defined metric (e.g. phone calls)
   * In check sheets the categories and times are well defined (e.g. day vs reason)
   * Whenever it's useful to collect data repeatedly, defects, defect causes
   * Design check sheets with the team, keep it clear, include definition, example, explain the reason and train everyone. Validate it and improve! 
3. Histogram
   * Barchart for numerical data of a process (useful in large dataset)
   * Height bar = size of a group <> bar graph
   * Central tendency and variation, change according to bin size
   * analysis before/after process changes
4. Pareto
   * Simple powerful chart in descending order
   * useful to identify causes
   * 80/20 rule: 20% causes contribute to 80% issues
5. Fishbone
   * Brainstorming tool 4 RCA
   * Cause and effect / Ishikawa diagram
   * Team problem solving, useful with 5W analysis
   * Brainstorming session with blackboard, ask why something happen
   * 5M cathegories: Man Mehod Machine Material Mother-Nature
   * Useful to visualize Causes and effect, identify the most vital ones and structure a brainstorming session
   * Use it after data collected, use it to identify root couses and keep team united and focused
   * Tips: Use large whiteboard, photograph it, use 5W, involve people and leverage on opinions, drill down causes, summarize the event
6. 5W Analysis
   * iterative probing technoque to get to the root causes
   * Used with fishbone.
   * Given a fact A, ask why A holds? because B, ask why B holds? because C... 5 times.
   * Often 5 whys are sufficient to get to the root cause
   * Simple (no statistics stuff), yet powerful
   * Tips: Be specific, continue asking Why until everyone agrees or no answers.
   * Tips/2: Don't move to fix-it mode too soon, avoid bias
8. Run Charts
   * Useful to see Process performance in time
   * Trend chart / Time-series chart - a line chart in time
   * Often the median is in red
   * Useful to identify process variations, patterns, trends -> performance issues
   * Useful to validate improvements
   * Tips: validate data collection process and calculation, purpose of collection?
   * Tips/2: select time interval, annotate chart with labels of changes
   * Tips/3: Investigate outliers (distant from median), Investigate trends (grow, stable, decrease)

## Lean

* Tool based methodology focused on eliminating waste in a process from customer's perspective
* Value-added activity: any activity that brings value to the customer
* Non-Value-added activity: any activity that doesn't add market form, function or not necessary --> It should be ELIMINATED, SIMPLIFIED, REDUCED, INTEGRATED

## Kaizen

* Change for the better = kai + zen
* Any small improvement by everybody in all areas
* Reduce variations and defects
